A .asm file intended for EmulakASM should start with an org directive. Directives are used to tell EmulakASM specifics about
your code, such as where it needs to be located. Unlike most assemblers, where an object file is generated per-file, in EmulakASM,
we generate object files per-section. Start a new section with the section directive followed by an org directive, like so:

.section "Main"
.org $0000

The combination of those 2 directives will put the section "Main" at $0000 in the finished ROM. However, in this example:

.section "Lib Functions"
.org $0100

The combination of those 2 directives will put the section "Lib Functions" at $0100 in the finished ROM.
ROMS have a size limit, namely, $2000 bytes.

(Character break: Maybe I'll implement banking and add another $2000 to it, but who needs that much room?)

Other directives include:

.orgsection <name> <address>
	Syntactic sugar; equivalent to the section and org combo above.
